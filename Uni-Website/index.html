              "I am honoured and delighted to receive the Appen Prize for
              Excellence in Linguistics. It truly means the world to me to have
              my efforts and passion rewarded so generously. The prize is
              particularly meaningful to me as it exemplifies the
              cross-disciplinary nature of linguistics - specifically language
              and technology. I am deeply grateful for having been awarded this
              prize on academic merit, but I am also appreciative of what the
              award stands for. This prize has consolidated my view that
              linguistics truly is a field with fundamental relevance to a
              diverse range of fields. It has not only cemented my confidence to
              pursue my passion in linguistics, it has also motivated me to
              explore the synergy between linguistics and technology."

              firsthand the implications of not developing sustainable cities. I
